## Icons
By default ng-combo uses Fontawesome Free to display icons (such as dropdown icon in the input).
However no font library is included in this package - you have to provide it yourself.
When doing so, make sure CSS classes defining icons are in global context (in styles.scss) so that they are available even in child components.
